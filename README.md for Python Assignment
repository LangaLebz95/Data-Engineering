# Project-Langa

You are given a dataset that is stored in a CSV file. You can upload it to this notebook from the menu on the left (see the Folder icon). These are the first three rows of the file:

key,user,event,datetime
0,11,Corporate events,2019-03-01 14:54:31
1,88,Team building event,2020-05-14 22:22:47
Here are the name, data type and description for each column.

key (integer) - a row key that should uniquely indenify a row
user (integer) - a user id
event (string) - e.g a Conference, Team building event, ...
datetime (datetime) - e.g. 2019-03-01 14:45:31
Your task is to write Python code to perform the following actions:

Load the dataset into memory

Inspect and clean the data set. Questions to investigate include:

Are there any duplicate rows?
Are there any rows missing?
Are values missing?
Are there any invalid values such as a negative time?
...
Filter out events that occurred before 2020-01-01 00:00:00.

Group the events by user and event.

For each group, calculate:

the number of events that occurred
the average time difference between consecutive events.
Store the result in a new CSV file with the following format:

user, event, number_of_events, average_time_difference
